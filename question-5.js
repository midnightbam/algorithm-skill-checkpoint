What is the Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice of the Question 4. Explain your reason.
Answer: Big O notation for Function sortProductsByPrice is O(n^2).
The function uses bubble sort, which has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases.
This is becasue it has nested loops that go through the list of products multiple times, so the
time needed grows roughly with the square of the number of products.
