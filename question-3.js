What is the Big O notation for Function findStudentById . Explain your reason.
Answer: Big O notation for Function findStudentById is O(n).
In the worst case, the function may need to check each student in the array once,
resulting in a linear relationship between the number of students and the time taken to find a student by ID.


*/

/* 
What is the Big O notation for Function findProductPrice. Explain your reason.
Answer: Big O notation for Function findProductPrice is O(log n).
The function uses binary serach. Each step halves the search range,
so the number of comparrisons grows logarithmically with the number of products.


*/

/* 
Which function is more efficient and why?
Answer: function findProductPrice is more efficient is more efficient because O(log n) grows much slower than O(n) 
as the dataset size increases, making it faster for large arrays.
